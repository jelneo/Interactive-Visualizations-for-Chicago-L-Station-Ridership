# Interactive Visualizations for Chicago 'L' Station Ridership
**Won second place in [Global IoT Datathon](https://iotdatathons.com/) 2019**

## About
This project aims to help the Chicago Transit Authority visualize 'L' station metro ridership so that they can better plan resources, maintenance and train frequency based on  ridership data. Charts are built using Plotly which allows the user to zoom, pan and save the chart. Plotly charts also have the feature of comparing data on hover. This project breaks down ridership data into four granularity levels: year, month, day, and station levels. Various charts were used such as custom calendar heat maps and box plots to help users extract the most information from the data at one glance. Calendar heat maps allow comparison of ridership across the year on station-level to see which station has more traffic during different months. Also, by sorting the mean number of rides for each station by day type (weekday, saturday, sunday/holiday), we can see the top 5 stations for each day type. This information can help Chicago Transit Authority redirect resources to the station that needs it more. Overall, this project provides the statistics and correlation of ridership data in the form of various charts which would be extremely useful when organised into a dashboard.

I intended to come up with a machine learning model to predict ridership given a date but there wasn't enough time to finish it. Hence, the submission consists of visualizations only.
